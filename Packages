Description: wireless WEP/WPA cracking utilities
 aircrack-ng is an 802.11a/b/g WEP/WPA cracking program that can recover a
 40-bit, 104-bit, 256-bit or 512-bit WEP key once enough encrypted packets
 have been gathered. Also it can attack WPA1/2 networks with some advanced
 methods or simply by brute force.
 .
 It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations,
 thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools.
 It can also fully use a multiprocessor system to its full power in order
 to speed up the cracking process.
 .
 aircrack-ng is a fork of aircrack, as that project has been stopped by
 the upstream maintainer.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.
